0.1D0			! F0 maximum field amplitude in [a.u.] [real]
0.7353D0		! Omega photon energy in [a.u.] [real]
0.D0			! Phase [rad.] [real]

! REMARKS: Intensity in W.cm^-2 is deduced from the field amplitude using
! the formula I=3.51.10^16x|F0|Â².

! Pulse Temporal profile choices: SinSqr, Gaussian, Ramped
! SinSqr: Next line is the number of Optical Cycles [integer]
! Gaussian: Next line is Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)[a.u.] [real]
! Ramped: Next line is Ramped Cycles [integer], Flat Cycles [integer]

! Gauge choices: Length

! Defining more than one pulse: Copy lines 2-6 for every subsequent pulse
! Each pulse is define as it was at the origin but translated with the delay.
